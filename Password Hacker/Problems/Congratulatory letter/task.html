  <p>Imagine that you were instructed to write a congratulatory letter, mentioning all the employees of the IT department in it. You know for sure that the department has one tester, one project manager, but you don't know exactly how many developers are there.</p> 
  <p>Define a function&nbsp;<code class="java">congratulations()</code>&nbsp;that lists the names of everyone in the letter.<br> If the project manager is Alice, the tester is Mike, and the developers are Roman and Victoria, then the printed congratulation should look like this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Happy New Year! Take care of yourself and your loved ones!
For:
Alice
Mike
Roman
Victoria</code></pre> 
  <p>Pay attention to the order of names. First mention a project manager, then a tester, and then developers.&nbsp;Each name should be on a separate line!</p> 
  <p>Note that you do not need to call a function, just implement it.</p>
