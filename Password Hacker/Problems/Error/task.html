  <p>Alice has a file called&nbsp;<strong>"books.txt"&nbsp;</strong>with all the books that she needs to read for her class. Her professor added another book to the list, so Alice wants to add a new line to the file. Below you can see her code.</p> 
  <p>However, Alice has made a mistake&nbsp;and got a completely different result than expected. Fix her mistake.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Don't worry about closing the file here, it will be done under the hood.</p>
