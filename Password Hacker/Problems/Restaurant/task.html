  <p>Imagine you are having dinner in a very fancy restaurant, but unfortunately you don't have a lot of money with you. You want to have a main course, a dessert and a drink, but all that together shouldn't cost more than $30.</p> 
  <p>The names of the main courses, desserts and drinks are stored in the lists <code class="language-python">main_courses</code>, <code class="language-python">desserts</code> and <code class="language-python">drinks</code>&nbsp; respectively. The corresponding prices can be found in the lists <code class="language-python">price_main_courses</code>, <code class="language-python">price_desserts</code> and <code class="language-python">price_drinks</code>.</p> 
  <p>Consider each possible combination of a main course, dessert and a drink from those offered by the restaurant and print out only those meals that satisfy your budget, along with their total costs.</p> 
  <p>For instance, imagine the dishes and prices are as defined below:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">main_courses = ['beef stew', 'fried fish']
price_main_courses = [28, 23]

desserts = ['ice-cream', 'cake']
price_desserts = [2, 4]

drinks = ['cola', 'wine']
price_drinks = [3, 10]</code></pre> 
  <p>Then, your output should be the following:</p> 
  <p>fried fish ice-cream cola 28<br> fried fish cake cola 30</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-1221').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-1221" style="display:none;">
   Use 
   <code class="language-python">zip()</code> to simultaneously iterate over the tuples of the dishes and the tuples of their prices.
  </div>
